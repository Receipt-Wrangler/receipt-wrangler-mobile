/**
 * Blocks the ability of the typescript inferrence engine to be able to use the provided type as part of
 * inferring any type parameters from this usage.
 * @example
 * Primarily used to wrap parameters of functions in order to prevent the TypeScript inferrence engine
 * from inferring a type parameter of the function from the value provided to this parameter.
 * This essentially blocks the Contravariance of the function (through its parameters) so that the
 * function type parameter is purely determined by the Covariant requirements of the function's return type.
 * This is key to creating `StateOperator`s that are typed based on their contextual usage and not on the arguments
 * provided to them. This is critical for type safety and intellisense for State Operators.
 * Here is an example of how this benefits a state operator:
 * ```ts
 * declare function append<T>(items: NoInfer<T[]>): StateOperator<T[]>;
 * declare function appendBad<T>(items: T[]): StateOperator<T[]>;
 *
 * interface AAA {
 *   foo?: boolean;
 *   bar?: boolean;
 * }
 *
 * // Works
 * // (T in append is correctly inferred as AAA)
 * patch<{ test: AAA[] }>({ test: append([{ foo: true }]) });
 *
 * // Incorrectly throws: Type 'AAA' is not assignable to type '{ foo: true; }'.ts(2322)
 * // (T in appendBad is incorrectly inferred as { foo: true; })
 * patch<{ test: AAA[] }>({ test: appendBad([{ foo: true }]) });
 * ```
