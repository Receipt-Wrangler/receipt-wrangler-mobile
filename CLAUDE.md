This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Receipt Wrangler Mobile is a Flutter mobile application that provides a native interface for Receipt Wrangler, a receipt management and splitting system. The app enables users to manage receipts on the go with camera/gallery uploads, receipt scanning, group management, and receipt splitting capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Core Flutter Commands
- `flutter run` - Run the app on connected device/emulator
- `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK
- `flutter build ios` - Build iOS app
- `flutter test` - Run unit tests
- `flutter analyze` - Analyze Dart code for issues
- `dart format .` - Format Dart code
- `flutter clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Upgrade dependencies

### API Client
The project uses a generated OpenAPI client located in the `api/` directory. The client is imported as a local package dependency in pubspec.yaml.

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
The app uses Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier models:
- **AuthModel**: Authentication state, JWT tokens, API client configuration
- **GroupModel**: Group management and selection
- **ReceiptModel**: Receipt data, form state, and image handling
- **UserModel**: User profile and preferences
- **CategoryModel**, **TagModel**: Metadata management
- **SearchModel**: Search functionality with RxDart streams

### Navigation
Uses `go_router` with nested shell routes:
- **Group Selection Shell**: `/groups` with group selection UI
- **Group Context Shell**: `/groups/:groupId/*` with group-specific navigation
- **Search Shell**: `/search` with search interface
- Individual routes for receipt forms, viewing, and editing

### Core Directory Structure
- `lib/models/` - Provider-based state management models
- `lib/auth/` - Authentication screens and logic  
- `lib/groups/` - Group management, dashboards, receipts
- `lib/receipts/` - Receipt forms, viewing, image handling
- `lib/search/` - Search functionality
- `lib/shared/` - Reusable widgets and utilities
- `lib/client/` - OpenAPI client wrapper
- `lib/utils/` - Utility functions for auth, currency, dates, etc.

### Key Features
- **Receipt Management**: Create, edit, view receipts with items and images
- **Image Handling**: Camera/gallery upload with scanning capabilities
- **Group Management**: Multi-user groups with role-based access
- **Search**: Full-text search across receipts
- **Offline Support**: Secure token storage with refresh token flow

### Form Handling
Uses `flutter_form_builder` for complex forms with validation. Receipt forms support:
- Dynamic item lists with custom fields
- Image carousel with infinite scroll
- Category and tag selection
- Currency formatting and validation

### API Integration
- Generated OpenAPI client from backend specification
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Centralized client configuration in `OpenApiClient` singleton
- Secure token storage using `flutter_secure_storage`

## Development Notes

### Testing
The project includes unit tests for generated API models. Run tests with `flutter test`.

### Build Configuration
- Android configuration in `android/` directory
- iOS configuration in `ios/` directory  
- Web configuration in `web/` directory
- Custom fonts (Raleway) configured in pubspec.yaml
- Native splash screen and launcher icons configured
